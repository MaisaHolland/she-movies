# She Movies

## Initial idea
- application that provides information about films directed by women.
## Impediments
- Lack of API that details this kind of information easily.
## Result
- Regular app that provides information of popular, top rated and new movies.

### Structure
#### API
- The Movie Database (TMDB) free api
#### APP
- Package oriented structure (main, app, movies, data);
- Bloc Pattern;
- An attempt to follow SOLID principles;

#### Future improvements
- Better and more complete tests;
  -  Test repositories, services, blocs, widgets and views.
- Better reuse of code and widgets;
- Among thousands of other things :p
